Hey everyone

I‚Äôve created a UI that allows you to chat and write documents using 100% browser-based AI. There is no backend - your chats and documents are stored in your own browser. It supports Ollama too.

Try it yourself at https://www.papeg.ai

If you‚Äôre curious, you can find the source code on Github. There might still be a few minor bugs in it, if you spot one, please let me know?

CAN I INSTALL IT?

Yes, you can run it on your own device or local network as long as it‚Äôs for non-profit use.

WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS?

We often talk about making AI more accessible to everyone, and I believe the best way to do that is with browser-based technology. Even my mom can use this.

I also enjoy the idea that this project could offer a lot of people a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù AI experience, so they don‚Äôt need to pay a monthly fee to use popular AI features.

WHAT‚ÄôS THE BUSINESS MODEL?

There isn‚Äôt one.¬†

I work as a digital artist in Europe, and usually get cultural funding for my work. This time I got so excited that I still have to figure out how I‚Äôm going to recoup my time. I‚Äôm curious: do you think companies would be willing to pay a few euro per user a month to use this?

CAN I RUN MY OWN MODELS?

Yes! You can create custom AI models, which can be as simple as pointing to a GGUF file on HuggingFace. And you can share that new model just as easily, with a link. Ollama is also supported.

Here's an example that will load a small Llama3 reasoning model.

Go get funding and figure out how to make money later! I think what you have is really great, and it's a great time to get funding for AI projects. Europe needs more for-profit companies in the AI field :)

And running everything locally is needed for many use cases, like translating sensitive documents. I think you are just at the right time to found a company that does this.

Where do you put the files? They are so big?

It automatically started to download files when I asked the first question, which is not good. You should put a warning and disclaimer before it actually starts to download any files.

They are stored in your browser's cache. Modern browsers have multiple ways of storing large files long-term (e.g. indexDB, Cache).

If your device is running low on storage, your browser might clear some of the AI models automatically. But Chrome, for instance, allows your browser cache to take up 80% of your disk space before it does anything like that (which is wild if you think about it).

Does it let you connect to external API? My client is definitely not powerful enough to run anything of substance in transformers.js but I have 70b+ I can access on my lan. It's not through ollama though so preferably openAI compatible.

No, that is not supported (but perhaps you can tell me how I could implement that easily?).

I hope you get a shitload of good karma from the universe for this, rock the fuck on man ü§òü§ñ

This shares a lot of what I've been building into my own chain. The URL share and simple web-based interface is sooo fuckin clean brotherüëå Thank you. I hope people are decent enough to not abuse this. This sounds weird until you think about it, but if we keep good karma like this in the OSS world, alignment won't be a problem.
