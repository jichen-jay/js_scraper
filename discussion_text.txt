       Getting ROCm installed on Debian 12 
    
      
    
      
    
  
      
      
     
    
      
    
    I'm experimenting with Debian 12 (stable) after using Kubuntu for a while, and it works perfectly for me in every way but one, and it's the most important one unfortunately. The only thing keeping me from switching to it is that I can't find a way to install ROCm so that I can do GPU rendering in Blender with my AMD card.
  
    ROCm only officially supports Ubuntu (and only up to 22.04, which is about to go EoL) and not Debian explicitly; but I'm going off the premise that Ubuntu is just Debian with some pepper on it, so anything that works in the former really should work in the latter with just maybe a couple of extra steps involved. This seems to be supported by older comments I've found from people saying that they've been able to get ROCm working in Debian previously.
  
    Anyway, I follow the instructions given here for installing ROCm via the package manager. Amdgpu-dkms seems to install without any complaints, although the system for some reason can't find the command "dkms status". But ROCm itself won't install at all; after sudo apt install rocm it says
  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 rocm-gdb : Depends: libpython3.10 but it is not installable or
                     libpython3.8 but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
    And this is the one hurdle I just can't get past. Debian 12 has Python 3.11.2, but Pythons 3.10 and 3.8 or their libraries are not available in any repositories. I've gone as far as just downloading them separately from Python's website and installing them (as non-default, but definitely there as confirmed by --version checks) but even when I do that apt can't see them when I try to install ROCm.
  
    GPU rendering in Blender is a hard requirement; if I can't do it, I can't switch to Debian, and I really want to switch to Debian. Does anyone have any suggestions?
  
    Edit: Problem solved using u/gee-one 's solution, which you can read at his github here: https://gitlab.com/gee-one/debian-12-rocm
